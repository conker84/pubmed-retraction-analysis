## Working broken Python installations on OS X El Capitan

OSX 10.11 ships with a known broken python installation. Install
homebrew and then install python:

    $ /usr/bin/ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"
    $ brew install python

## Installing dependencies

Before you do anything, go install [node](http://nodejs.org).

You will also need to install pip from `easy_install` and virtualenv
from `pip` systemwide:

   $ sudo easy_install pip
   $ sudo pip install virtualenv

Once you're done with that `npm install` will install all the dependencies.

## Database

The database uses neo4j. You can set this up locally by following
the instructions at neo4j.org, or you can access a public database at
the URL specified in the private documentation.

### Administration

You can interact with the database by using the db/db-admin.js script.

You will need to provide credentials in DATABASE_USER, DATABASE_PASS
and the database URL (shared secretly) in DATABASE_URL.

Once the program starts, you can just start running neo4j database
commands and you'll get the result back. Hit Ctrl^C to quit.
